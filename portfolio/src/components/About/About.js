                    <span className="About-discrip">Driven by a passion for technology and a knack for creative problem-solving, I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in Finance at Oregon State University. My educational journey has been a rich tapestry of diverse courses, ranging from "Integral Design Engineering and Problem Solving" to "Introduction to Computer Science," providing me with a well-rounded foundation in both technical and business-related disciplines.

                    Outside the work, I immerse myself in a world of hobbies that balance my academic pursuits. üì∑ Photography allows me to capture the beauty of fleeting moments, while my love for traveling ‚úàÔ∏è takes me to new destinations, enriching my perspective of different cultures. In the kitchen, I enjoy the art of cooking üç≥, experimenting with flavors to create culinary delights. My adventurous spirit is further fueled by rock climbing üßó, a hobby that challenges me physically and mentally, pushing my limits amidst nature's grandeur.
